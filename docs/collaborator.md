# Adding Collaborators

> CircuitVerse allows the users to add collaborator(s) to their projects.

Contributing Authors: [@amansingla97](https://github.com/amansingla97/)

The user can add CircuitVerse members by adding their email-ids separated by comma. Collaborates can access as well as update the project.

** Note: Collaboration is not synced between the changes made by collaborators. Every save overwrites and updates the project.**
